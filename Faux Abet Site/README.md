This is a website that consists of a login page, and a main page that shows data for a given class, and allows both for reading and changing said data. The site can still be viewed, but the database it connected to is no longer active.
<br><p>The login page front-end is handled by login.php, which has the form structure and calls login2.php on submitting, and login.css, which styles the forms and buttons. Login2.php takes in the login information, checks if the user is valid, and if so, returns their information for the main page to use.</p>
<p>The banner at the top is handled by nav.php, which has a drop down menu for classes, and a link to change passwords and logging out in the top right corner. nav.css styles it. Nav.js handles all of the buttons, and calls various .php files to communicate with the SQL server.</p>
<p>Abet.php handles the body of the main page, which shows, for a given class and section, the existing data and a menu to change it. Abet.css styles it, and abet.js handles the delete buttons.</p>
<p>Password.php is the password page, which is styled by password.css. Nav.js handles its buttons as well, since nav.js is a constant among the main and password pages.</p>
<p>The rest of the php files are SQL queries.</p>
