This was the final project of my Database and Scripting Languages class.
The teacher gave us a few screenshots of what he wanted, along with descriptions of the functionality, and had us code it in parts. While I cannot access it in github, it was able to access a MariaDB SQL server, and edit it. 
While we had the option to complete it as a group project, I worked alone for this.
