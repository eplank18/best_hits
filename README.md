My name is Emily Plank, and this is a collection of the work I feel the most proud of, from school or otherwise. 
The projects here at the moment are:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Faux Abet Website</strong>: Code for a website that uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL to edit and display data to a user.</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics Final Project</strong>: Code for a website that uses WebGL to display several objects, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript to allow the user to edit an aspect of it.</li>
  </ol>
  Please click on each of the directories, and the READMEâ€™s there will guide you through the projects.
