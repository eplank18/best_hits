This is the final project of my Graphics class. 
The graphics themselves are not impressive, but I am proud of the html/css/jquery additions that allowed fog sliders, so each object could have a different amount of fog that the user selects.
This was done alone, but with heavy TA help. Graphics do not come easily to me.
